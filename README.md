# VoltEdge Electronics: 2020 Sales Performance Analysis
## Project Background
VoltEdge Electronics, a global electronics retailer, faced a challenging year in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, economic downturns, and shifts in consumer behavior significantly impacted sales performance. As a data analyst, my role is to evaluate the companyâ€™s sales trends, diagnose key problems, uncover growth opportunities, and provide strategic recommendations for 2020.
## Data Structure Overview
The analysis is based on data from five key tables:

1. **Sales**: Contains order details such as order number, product information, transaction dates, customer and store identifiers, and sales metrics.

2. **Customers**: Provides demographic and geographic details of customers, including gender, location, and birthdate.

3. **Products**: Lists product attributes such as name, brand, category, pricing, and cost details.

4. **Stores**: Contains store-specific information, including location, floor area, and store opening date.

5. **Exchange Rates**: Tracks currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar over time.
